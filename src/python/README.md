This directory contains Python scripts for the main control logic of the OmniTrek Rover.

## Virtual Environment Setup

Always use a virtual environment for development:

```bash
# Navigate to project root
cd ~/omnitrek_project

# Create virtual environment if it doesn't exist
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
